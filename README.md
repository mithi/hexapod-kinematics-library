Code you can use to solve forward and inverse kinematics, generate walk sequences of hexapod robots as copied from [Mithi's Bare-Minimum Hexapod Robot Simulator 2](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod) - [commit id] (https://github.com/mithi/hexapod/commit/467d1a3b92dabd0304c7ef4675d64179f82efb69)

Docs are written in the files themselves:

-   [`VirtualHexapod`](./src/VirtualHexapod)
-   [`getWalkSequence`](./src/solvers/walkSequenceSolver)
-   [`solveInverseKinematics`](./src/solvers/)

You can also inspect the test directory to see examples of how its used.
